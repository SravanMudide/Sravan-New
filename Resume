Major project: ‘Power quality improvement in conventional Electronic Load Controller for an Isolated Power Generation’. 
Power quality improvement in a conventional electronic load controller (ELC) used for isolated pico-hydropower generation based on an asynchronous generator (AG)

I also participated in Project expo conducted by the Kakatiya University on ‘Power Generation with the help of Speed Breakers. Electricity is generated by replacing the traditional speed breakers with some simple mechanism. As vehicles pass over the speed breakers, they spin the rollers which are connected to a generator which in turn generate electricity
